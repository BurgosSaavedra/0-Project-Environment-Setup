Poetry notes:
1. First of all let's install poetry. To do that run:

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

Verify the installation by running:

poetry --version

After verifying that everything went well with poetry installation, let's upgrade it to the 
latest version by running the command:

poetry self update

Alright, now, the first thing we need to do to create a pyproject.toml file.
Because we are going to specify our dependencies in this file. Poetry uses pyproject.toml
file to store all the dependencies, and also its configuration. In order to create a simple
pyproject.toml file run:

poetry init

It is going to ask you a few questions. Don't woory, they are very easy to answer :)

Alright, poetry created a simple pyproject.toml file for us. Let's take a look at what we have
in this file...

BLACK NOTES:

As the first step, let's install black, isort, flake8 and mypy

Next, call "poetry update"

As the next step, we are going to add some configurations for these tools. There is a prest of configuration
values I prepared for you. You don't need to understand each and every one of them. You can just copy and paste 
them between your projects. Later on if there will be a case in which you will need to change some of them, you
can search on the internet for more information about them. We specify configuration parameters for these tools in
pyproject.toml file. One unfortunate thing about flake8 is that it doesn't support configuration in pyproject.toml
file. We need to create another file called setup.cfg for that. Hopefully flake8 will support pyproject.toml file 
in the future, so that we won't need to create another file only for flake8.

TALK ABOUT THE PACKAGE NAME IN THE CONFIG FILES!!!

Alright, let's now see some examples of using these tools, and what these tools can do for us.
